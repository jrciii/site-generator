This site is generated by means of:

- [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] - For compiling this static website using a combination of
  html templates and org files
- Various [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] files (which I use to organize about every aspect of my life)
- [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] (for syncing org files from multiple devices)
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] editor for Org-mode and just general awesomeness and supplying
  us the whole world at our fingertips. At the time of this writing I
  am even using the [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][Emacs X Window Manager (EXWM)]]
- [[http://www.orgzly.com/][Orgzly]] for basic editing of Org files on the go on my Android
  device, so that I can always save those fleeting ticklers or ideas and flesh
  them out in an organized way wherever I am. Besides being able to
  produce content for this site and other notes, I use it to keep track of my schedule
  and TODO lists on the go as well.

[[github.com/jrciii/site-generator][Heres the source for my Hakyll site generator]]

Hakyll, with the Pandoc compiler make it easy to fuse the daily
chronicling of things I learn, notable events, and whatever tickles my
fancy, with this site and by extension the rest of the world.

For example, a knowledge base composed of a directory of Org files
 that I will be editing on many different devices in many different
 locations, not just on the machine I will use to write posts. This
 knowledge base is symlinked from my syncthing folder to the site
 generator folder, where it gets compiled when I build my
 site. Basically all content on this site is compiled from org files
 linked from my main org repository.

There was one issue with the standard Hakyll example for achieving
everything I want on this site. I want to export org files that link
to other org files and have the links converted to the resulting .html
files. [[file:2021-03-14-orglinktohtml.org][The solution is detailed in my next blog post]].
