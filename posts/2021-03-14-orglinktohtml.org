title: Converting .org file links to .html links when compiling Org
date: 2021-03-14

In the knowledge base I am creating (a collection of articles and
thoughts that have helped me) I have links to other Org files to avoid
clutter and keep these pages loading fast. Suppose we have the
following link in an Org file

#+BEGIN_SRC org
* [[file:Python.org][Python]]
#+END_SRC

By default when this is compiled by Pandoc to html, it will remain as
a link to the org file

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<a href="Python.org">Python</a>
#+END_SRC
